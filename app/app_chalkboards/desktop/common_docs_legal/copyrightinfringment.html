 <h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
 <h3>Reporting Copyright Infringements</h3>
 <p>Chalkboards is a trademark of Orinoco Community System Inc. ("Orinoco") . Orinoco does not permit copyright
  infringing activities or any infringements of intellectual property rights on any of its platforms or websites
  ("Website"), and will remove all content if properly notified that such content infringes upon the intellectual
  property rights of any party. Notifications about copyright or intellectual property rights infringements stating the
  location of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed, should be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the
  Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (the "DMCA"), as detailed below.</p>
 <h3>Notice of Claims of Copyright Infringement</h3>
 <p>Pursuant to the DMCA provisions, Community has designated an agent ("Copyright Agent") to receive notifications
  of claimed copyright infringement on its Website. Please be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the
  termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers who infringe upon intellectual property rights.</p>
 <p>If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or that your
  intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide Community's designated Copyright Agent with
  the following information in accordance with the DMCA:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright
   or other intellectual property interest.</li>
  <li>A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed.</li>
  <li>A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located, detailed enough to be easily
   found by us; providing URLs in the body of an e-mail is the best way to help us locate content quickly; if possible,
   please add product identification (type of Community's application and/or service), dates, screenshots, and all other
   relevant details that will be sufficient to identify the alleged infringement you are objecting to.</li>
  <li>Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address.</li>
  <li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed usage is not authorized by the
   copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
  <li>A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and
   that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual
   property owner's behalf.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>All materials must be submitted in the English language. In the event that translated materials are used, please
  provide a notarized authorization of the translations.</p>
 <p>Following receipt of your communication, Community may ask you to provide further or supplemental information,
  prior to removing any content which was displayed on the Website, as Community deems necessary to comply with the
  provisions of the DMCA. Please note that Community may also provide the registered user who uploaded the allegedly
  infringing content with your contact details, in order for that person to be able to contact you directly and
  communicate with you regarding your notification.</p>
 <h3>Counter notification</h3>
 <p>You may submit a counter notification to the Copyright Agent. To be effective, your counter notification must be
  a written communication provided to the Copyright Agent that includes substantially the following:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
  <li>Identification of the material to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material
   appeared before access to it was disabled.</li>
  <li>A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was
   disabled as a result of mistake or mis-identification of the material to be disabled;</li>
  <li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal
   District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the
   United States, for any judicial district in which you may be found, and that you will accept service of process from
   the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>After receipt of a counter notification, Community will promptly provide the person who submitted the Claimed
  Copyright Infringement Notification with a copy of the counter notification, and will inform that person that
  Community will replace the removed material, or cease disabling access to that material in 10 business days.</p>
 <p>Community will then replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it between 10 to 14 business days
  following receipt of the counter notice, unless the Copyright Agent first receives notice from the person who notified
  Community of the claimed copyright infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain
  the registered user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Community's system or network.</p>
 <h3>Repeat infringements</h3>
 <p>Community may deny or cancel any individual use of the Website, or terminate your account, if Community
  determines in its sole discretion that you infringed upon copyrights of any third party or you are a repeat infringer.
  A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than once or a user that his or her
  uploaded material was removed from the Website more than once. Community may decide, at its sole discretion, that a
  sufficient reason exists for the immediate termination of your account for any reason, at any time. In these cases
  Community may terminate your account immediately. Community may notify you that it canceled your account by sending a
  message to the e-mail address that you provided during the registration process. Such notification will come into
  effect immediately.</p>
 <h3>Misrepresentations</h3>
 <p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that: (1)
  that material is infringing, or (2) that material was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be
  liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, that Community may incur, if it is injured by such
  misrepresentation, as the result of its reliance upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the
  material claimed to be infringing.</p>
