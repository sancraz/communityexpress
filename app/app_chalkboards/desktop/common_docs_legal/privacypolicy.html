 <h2>Aggregated or anonymized information</h2>
 <p>Orinoco collects within the operation of the App and Website anonymized as well as aggregated information, which does
  not identify you personally. Such anonymized or aggregated information may be used in any way, including by posting,
  disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making it available to any other third party.</p>
 <h2>Third party links</h2>
 <p>The Website may contain or present third party links to third party sites or services - all of which are not
  owned or controlled by us. Though we collect certain parameters related to your interactions with these third-party
  services (as detailed in this Policy), we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party sites or
  services and this Policy does not apply to them. Please refer to the privacy policies of those other sites and
  services, to determine whether their privacy practices are acceptable to you.</p>
 <h2>Transfer of Data outside Your Territory</h2>
 <p>The App and Website, by their nature as an online service, may store and process information in Europe, the United States
  and in other various locations throughout the globe. If you are a resident in a jurisdiction where transfer of your
  personal information to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you provide your express and unambiguous
  consent to such transfer.</p>
 <h2>Use of Cookies and Server Logs</h2>
 <p>Cookies (which may be HTML files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user
  preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to
  collect data, such as counting page views or promotion views. The Website may use "cookies", "web beacons" and other
  similar information-gathering technologies (collectively, "Information Gathering Technologies") to collect non-PII
  automatically as you access and browse the Website. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Orinoco only
  and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.</p>
 <p>Orinoco uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Orinoco uses session cookies to make it easier
  for you to navigate the Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
  on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may remove persistent cookies by following directions provided
  in your Internet browser's "help" file. We set a persistent cookie for such uses as to store your app name and/or user
  name so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
  of our users to enhance the users' experience on the Website. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Website,
  but your ability to use some areas of the Website may be limited.</p>
 <p>By visiting the Website, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree
  that you are giving us your consent to gather information about your use of the Website through these Information
  Gathering Technologies.</p>
 <p>Server logs capture certain non-PII, such as the time and date of a App usage or web visit, the browser and operating system
  being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is
  generally but not exclusively used to help plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content that is
  compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems.</p>
 <h2>Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
 <p>You may send us a request to access the Personally Identifiable Information that we may collect through your use
  of the App or Website or the Orinoco Platform. We may require that you provide us with additional information to verify
  your identity.</p>
 <h2>Data Retention</h2>
 <p>We may delete your Personally Identifiable Information from our systems or anonymize it if we deem it no longer
  necessary for our reasonable business needs.</p>
 <h2>Security</h2>
 <p>
  The security of your personal information is important to us, and we implement measures to secure your Personally
  Identifiable Information, to the extent collected, to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and
  unauthorized access or use of information, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission
  over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is absolutely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
  commercially acceptable means to protect and secure your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee and
  you cannot reasonably expect that the Website and the Orinoco Platform and its databases will be immune from any
  wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse. If you have any
  questions about security on the Website, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@chalkboards.today">contact@sitelette.com</a>
 </p>
 <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
 <p>
  This Policy may be changed from time to time. Substantial changes will take effect thirty (30) days after an initial
  notification is posted on the Website or communicated to you via email. Other changes will take effect seven (7) days after their initial posting.
  However, if the Policy is amended to comply with legal requirements, the amendments will become effective immediately
  upon their initial posting, or as required. The most up-to-date Policy is accessible on the Website at: <a

 You agree to be bound by any of the changes made to this Policy. Your continued use of the App and the Website after the changes
